# Total Home Score Components
React and vanilla javascript components for rendering Total Home Score livability scores, powered by the [Shine Api](https://developers.solarialabs.com).

Total Home Score livability scores give you insights on what you can expect from day-to-day life in a home. From neighborhood noise to how easy it is to get to amenities like grocery stores and restaurants, youâ€™ll know how this home compares to others in the same neighborhood.

## Shine Api Account
A Shine Api account and an associated `apiKey` is required to leverage these components. For more information and details on how to sign up for an account, check out https://developers.solarialabs.com/apis

Once you have created an account, you will need to generate an `apiKey` to leverage within these components. This can be done by creating an `App` within the Shine Api developer portal, and choosing the `Total Home Score` product. The `Consumer Key` can then be leveraged as an `apiKey` for these components.

## Example of Total Home Score Component

Note: This example wraps the component in a Bootstrap card with a header.

## Usage
This repository contains both React and vanilla javascript components, as well as a basic stylesheet.

### Library Prereqs
In order to leverage the React or vanilla javascript components, the following prereqs must be met:
* React
* Bootstrap CSS or equivalent stylesheet
* [Optional] [Popper.js](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/popovers/) or equivalent for tooltips
* [Optional] [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) or equivalent for tooltips

**Note:** Some of these prereqs are defined as peer dependenices, but none are defined as explicit dependencies.

### React Component
To leverage the React component, install the following package from `npm`:

```bash
npm install https://github.com/SolariaLabs/total-home-score-components/releases/download/v0.1.0/shine-api-total-home-score-0.1.0.tgz
```

Once installed, this component can be leveraged in your app by passing in the `apiKey` from your Shine Api App and the `lat` and `lon` coordinates for the desired location to display information for. 

```javascript
import React from 'react';

import TotalHomeScore from '@shine-api/total-home-score';
import '@shine-api/total-home-score/dist/main.css';

const apiKey = 'API_KEY_FROM_SHINE_API';
const lat = 42;
const lon = -71;

const ExampleApp = () => (
  <div>
    <TotalHomeScore apiKey={apiKey} lat={lat} lon={lon} />
  </div>
);
```

### Plain Javascript Component
To leverage the plain javascript component, the following two script tags to your page, and a div container for the widget to get added to:

```html
<div id="widget-container"></div>
<script lang="text/javascript">
  TotalHomeScore = {
    apiKey: 'API_KEY_FROM_SHINE_API',
    lat: 42,
    lon: -71,
    id: "widget-container"
  }
</script>
<script src="<path_to_js_file>"></script>
```

The script tags will import the javascript component and place dom elements inside of the given `widget-container` element.
